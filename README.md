# Lively Kernel

For general information about the Lively Kernel, see http://lively-kernel.org/.

This repository is a fork of the Lively Kernel Webwerkstatt repository at HPI (http://www.lively-kernel.org/repository/webwerkstatt/). We want to use it in order to

- reorganize the code
- modularize the code
- fix bugs without keeping others from doing their work
- be able to create stable milestones instead of rolling releases

Changes in this repository are likely to be ported back to Webwerkstatt.

In /apache_config you can find sample config files for Apache. Soon there will be more documentation on how to install Lively locally on different systems. We are also considering alternative deployment options besides Apache.
